# BUILDING

NOTE: You do not need to do this unless you want to modify the source code.

## Following is for Windows and for Linux

1. Install community edition of Intellij
2. Install the RUST plugin in Intellij
3. Unzip the 'saitekradio2-1.zip', it will make a directory 'saitekradio'
4. In Intellij, open existing project 'saitekradio'
5. Away you go!

The debug version generated by the 'compile' button in Intellij will be in
saitekradio/target/debug/saitekradio[.exe]

You make the (delivered) version from the 'saitekradio' directory using:

- `cargo build --release`

which will be in target/release

Note: the saitekradio executable will accept parameters:

- `saitekradio[.exe] [output IP address [input IP address]]`

if you wish to run it on a remote machine.

A useful addition to the Windows installation procedure would be some automation (the author is
neither a user nor a developer on Windows).
