# BUILDING

NOTE: You do not need to do this unless you want to modify the source code.

## Following is for Windows and for Linux

1. Install VSCode or the community edition of Intellij
2. Install the RUST plugin in either
3. In either, open directory `code/saitekradio`
5. Away you go!

The debug version generated by the 'compile' button in Intellij will be in
`'code/saitekradio/target/debug/saitekradio[.exe]'`. 

For vscode, use 

- `cargo build`

in the terminal window to produce the same file.

You make the (delivered) version from the 'code' directory using:

- `cargo build --release`

which will be in `target/release`
and, on Linux, reduce the size of the executable (by 3MB!!) with:

- `strip target/release/saitekradio`


Note: the `saitekradio` executable will accept parameters:

- `saitekradio[.exe] [output IP address [input IP address]]`

if you wish to run it on a remote machine.

A useful addition to the Windows installation procedure would be some automation (the author is
neither a user nor a developer on Windows).
