INSTALLATION
============

Download project from Github, and extract the contents into a working directory
(which may be discarded after installation is complete).

On Linux:

Type:
	sudo make install

If the Radio Panel is plugged in, disconnect and reconnect it to change the access
permissions.

The driver can then be started with the command 'saitekradio'

On Windows:

Copy saitekradio.exe to a convenient location.
Copy saitekradio.xml to C:/Program Files/Flightgear 2020.3/data/Protocol

You may need to create the directory(folder) Nasal below.
Copy saitekradio.nas to <username>/Appdata/Roaming/flightgear.org/Nasal

On Linux or Windows:

Plug the Saitek Radio into a USB port.

Start the handler by running 'saitekradio' or 'saitekradio.exe'

The radio display will show ascending/descending digits on the Radio display.
Press either of the ACT/STBY keys, and the display will blank alternate digits.

In the FGFS Start Screen, in 'Settings/Additional settings', insert the following:

--generic=socket,out,30,127.0.0.1,60001,udp,saitekradio
--generic=socket,in,20,,60002,udp,saitekradio

and start the simulator.
Shortly, the display will change to show the selected radio details.
When the aircraft has fully loaded, all the radio panel controls will be active.


If the program terminates unexpectedly, re-run under the command-line interface
to be able to read the (hopefully useful) error message.
