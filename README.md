FGFS DRIVER FOR SAITEK RADIO PANEL
==================================
   
This project provides an interface between Flightgear Flight Simulator and the
Saitek Radio Panel. The simulated aircraft's radio settings are shown in
real time on the RadioPanel's display, and the ACT/STBY switches and the rotary
control operation is handed to the Simulator for action. 

To install, follow the instructions in INSTALL.

Executable images are provided for Linux and Windows. The code base is identical
for Linux and Windows and is written in Rust. This my (Dave Attwood's) first Rust program, 
so experienced Rustaceans may like to comment - all contributions welcomed!
If you would like to improve the code or automate the Windows installation, please issue a 'pull' request. 

This project is the successor to daibach142/FGFS_Saitek_Radio on GitHub.

For problems or issues either enter an issue on Github, or email stkrp@attwoods.org.uk.
